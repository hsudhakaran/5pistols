We’re all connected to the alcoholic beverage or exports industry in some way or another, from operations, new product development, international trade, sales and marketing, supply chain and exports, and we we’re sharing some knowledge, having a couple of laughs. When the conversation turned too: If you could start a business, what would it be? We threw around some ideas when someone said: Look, we’ve got all of this expertise, work experience and global beverage knowledge between us. Isn’t there something interesting there?</p>
